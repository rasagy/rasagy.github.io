      <description>I was invited to conduct a two-week virtual Design Workshop at National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad for B.Des. 7th sem students.
My workshop focused on an introduction to Data Visualization, Visual Encoding, Data Storytelling &amp;amp; Cartography.
Hometown Schematic Map One of the exercises done in the workshop was to create a schematic map of their hometown, focused on a particular audience &amp;amp; purpose for this map. Some of the selected maps are shared below with their process, and the complete discussion &amp;amp; references are available on this Github issue.</description>
