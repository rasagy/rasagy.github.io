      <description>I was invited back at my alma mater to teach M.Des. Information Design students for their Geo Visualization &amp;amp; Digital Cartography module, led by Prof. Chakradhar Saswade. My sessions focused on an introduction to Cartography, types of Geo Visualization, Sensory Mapping &amp;amp; Schematic Mapping.
Hometown Schematic Map One of the exercises was to create a schematic map of their hometown, focused on a particular audience &amp;amp; purpose for this map. Some of the selected maps are shared below with their process, and the complete discussion &amp;amp; references are available on this Github issue.</description>
