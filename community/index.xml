      <description>I got invited to conduct a virtual, interactive workshop on data storytelling, for MIT ID Innovation Program’s Virtual GradShow.
In the workshop, I explained why data needs to be narrated as stories, showed some case studies by Gramener &amp;amp; walked through the process of going from data analysis to narrating a story. I also focused on how design thinking’s user-centricity &amp;amp; encoding principles based on visual perception enable us to visualize insights that are useful &amp;amp; engaging.</description>
