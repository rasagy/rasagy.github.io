Repo for personal website
=========================

## Setup

**Domain:** My user repo `rasagy.github.io` is mapped to my custom domain: `rasagy.in`.

**Github Pages + Hugo:** Website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo config sits in a separate (private) repo, and the published `/public` folder is pushed to this repo.
